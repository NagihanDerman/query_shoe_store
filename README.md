### Query Shoe Store

This project is a responsive shoe store application developed using modern web technologies such as React, React Router, Axios, and more. It allows users to browse and filter shoes based on color, size, gender, and price. The app also includes detailed pages for each shoe to provide users with comprehensive information about the selected product.

### Features

- Filterable Product Listings: Users can filter shoes based on:
  Color
  Size
  Gender
  Price
- Detailed Product Pages: Each shoe has a detailed page where users can view more in-depth information.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to work on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- Error and Loading States: The app handles loading states with spinners and provides meaningful error messages when something goes wrong.
- Notifications: Notifications are displayed using react-toastify for better user feedback.

### Technologies Used

- React : The main library for building the user interface.
- React Router DOM: For navigation between different pages (e.g., shoe listing and details).
- Axios: For making HTTP requests to fetch data from the API (powered by json-server).
- @tanstack/react-query: For managing and caching server state, making it easier to handle API requests, loading, and error states efficiently.
- React Toastify : For toast notifications.
- use-debounce: To debounce user inputs like filter options to improve performance.
- JSON Server : A simple backend to mock API calls and serve product data.
